# Plotly
plotly.py, colloquially referred to as Plotly, is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library. It offers Python-based charting, powered by plotly. js. The library ships with over 30 chart types, including scientific charts, 3D graphs, statistical charts, SVG maps, financial charts, and more

The main plus point of plotly is its interactive nature and of course visual quality. Plotly is in great demand rather than other libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Plotly provides a list of charts having animations in 1D, 2D, and 3D too for more details of charts check
